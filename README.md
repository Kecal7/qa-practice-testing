# QA Portfolio Project – QA Practice App

This repository contains comprehensive testing documentation and materials for the open-source [QA Practice App](https://qa-practice.netlify.app/). The project demonstrates my skills in manual, automated, API, performance, and security testing.

## 🔍 Project Objectives

- Execute **manual functional and UI tests** across multiple features.
- Identify and document bugs with clear reproduction steps and evidence.
- Create and run **automated tests** using tools like Selenium, Playwright, or Cypress.
- Perform **API testing** with Postman or similar tools.
- Conduct **performance/load testing** using JMeter or Locust.
- Explore **basic security testing** scenarios (e.g. input validation, auth flaws).

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **Manual Testing:** Chrome DevTools, exploratory techniques, bug reporting
- **Automation:** Selenium, Playwright, Cypress
- **API Testing:** Postman, RESTful endpoints, JSON
- **Performance Testing:** JMeter, Locust
- **Security Testing:** OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite (basic use)

## 📈 Test Coverage Highlights

- UI and usability testing
- Form validation
- Login and authentication flows
- CRUD operations
- Responsive design checks
- Bug identification and documentation
- REST API validation
- Load simulation and performance analysis

## 📌 Notes

- This project is part of my QA portfolio and aims to simulate real-world testing workflows.
- All test artifacts were created by me for demonstration and learning purposes.
- The application under test is publicly accessible and designed for testing practice.
